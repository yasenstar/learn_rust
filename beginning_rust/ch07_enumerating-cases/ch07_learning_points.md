# ch07 Enumerating Cases

## Learning Points

- How __enums__ help in defining variables that can take on values only from a finite set of cases
- How enums can be used to implement discriminated union types
- How to use the __match__ pattern-matching construct to handle enums
- How to use the __match__ construct to handle other data types, like integer numbers, strings, and single characters
- How to use Boolean guards to generalize the pattern-matching of the __match__ construct
