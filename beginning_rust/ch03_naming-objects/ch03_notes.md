# Naming Objects

## Concepts of "value", "object", and "variable"

| Name | Concept|
| --- | --- |
| value | an abstract, mathematical concept. You can store Value in memory and can store same value in several locations of the memory. |
| object| the portion of memory that contains a value. Two distinct objects locate in different positions of memory, are said to be "equal" if they contain the same value. |
| variable | the identifier-object paris are called "variables"

## Conecpt of "mutability" of variables

## Difference between "initialization" and "re-assignment"

## Avoid warnings for unused variables

## Concept of "Boolean Expression"

The relational operators for boolean are the following ones:

- ==!: is equal to
- !=: is different from (not equal to)
- <: is less than
- <=: is less than or equal to
- >: is greater than
- >=: is greater than or equal to

Boolean expressions:

- "!": read "not"
- "&&", read "logical-and"
- "||", read "logical-or"
