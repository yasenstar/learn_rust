# Controlling Execution Flow

Key leaning points:

- Use IF statements to execute different statements based on a Boolean condition
- Use IF expressions to generate different values based on a Boolean condition
- Use WHILE statements to repeat some statements as long as a Boolean condition holds
- Use FOR statements to repeat some statements for a definite number of times
